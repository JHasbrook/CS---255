Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass project is a company geared towards improving the passing rate of driving test,
by providing the most relevant laws and regulations, and allowing drive time with a teacher. 
The client is the product owner, Liam. The system he wanted me to design covers some basic and 
intuitive ideas. Firstly, the system needs to be able to make and modify driving reservations. 
The system should also have all updated laws and regulations that one would see on a driving test or exam.
He also wanted this "classroom" side to be accessible if a student did not have an internet connection. 


What did you do particularly well?

I believe that the tasks I did particularily well, was designing my activity diagrams. Those diagrams felt very fluid and I could logically work
through them, while also maitaining clear structure. I am confident enough to make a whole activity diagram that links the activities of the entire
system into a flow diagram of sorts. Certainly my favorite thing I worked on for this project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably revise my class diagram and go more in depth, however it's difficult to plan for coding specifics without ever little restraint
and preference that the product owner desires. I did a very basic class diagram that just shows the main classes and how they associated with each other.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When designing a project like this, we aren't designing it for ourselves asa the developer, despite how much it hurts with biases we may have. 
This is all about putting oursleves in the shoes of the user, whether they be the student, teacher, or admin. The student needs to be able to access 
the material and schedule reservations. The admin needs to have access to manage the users and or reservation availiblities. This is why it's important to 
take ALL users into consideration when planning for the design of a system. Accessibility is key and everything should be very inuitive because the 
technology skills could differ across all users.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software designing in a sort of set basis, I usually follow the following: 
understanding the requirements --> defining my restraints --> defining the goals 
--> create scalability outline --> designing system architecture --> identifying key components and their interactions.
This is the basic flow of my mind when approaching a new project, bigger projects would likely have more steps for me.
I think if I had the connection in the future I would promote cross-disciplinary collaboration and use other areas of expertise to 
get best use opinions and see what good ideas for accessibility exist.
